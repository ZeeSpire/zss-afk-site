Every year, Romanians have reasons to celebrate both on November 30th and December 1st, which are also public holidays. In 2024, these celebrations will fall on a weekend, specifically on Saturday and Sunday.

On November 30th, Romanians celebrate Saint Andrew, the protector of Romania and the "Apostle of the Romanians," who brought Christianity to the territory of modern-day Romania.

Romania’s National Day is celebrated on December 1st, marking the Great Union of 1918. On this historic day, the National Assembly in Alba Iulia voted to unite Transylvania, Banat, Crișana, and Maramureș with Romania, completing the unification of all Romanian-inhabited provinces.

We’ve gathered some special offers from guesthouses in Romania, created especially for this festive weekend.
