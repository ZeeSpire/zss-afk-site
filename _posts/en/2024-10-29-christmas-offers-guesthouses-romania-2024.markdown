I have selected offers from various guesthouses in Romania for you. This selection is not exhaustive; it simply reflects my personal preferences. In this article, I have included the packages that I found most interesting and ordered them in ascending order by price. The prices listed are those from the guesthouses' websites at the time of writing this article and refer to the lowest rates available for a double room. I have only included places that have rooms available at the time of publication, but these can sell out quickly. I hope you find an offer that suits you and have a wonderful Christmas!
